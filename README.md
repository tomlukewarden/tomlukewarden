# Hi there! 👋 I'm Tom Warden

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of C++ in preparation for my MSc in Computer Science.
- 💻 I’m working on a client app for Culley & McAlpine Solicitors and updating their website: [Culley & McAlpine](https://www.culleymcalpine.co.uk/).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was part of a podcast called FOMO! We were one of Apple's top podcasts in 2022.
